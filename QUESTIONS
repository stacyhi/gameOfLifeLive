## Part 1
- What the hell is going on?
  - What do you start looking at?

- Why does tick take future?
  A: Boards are somewhat expensive, so we're reusing them. Tick therefore
     can't return a Board (it would have to allocate it), so it takes a Board
     to write its output into.
- In a forEach, what does this refer to?
  A: Global. You can also specify:
    [1].forEach(function() { console.log(this) }, 'hello')
  will print 'hello'
